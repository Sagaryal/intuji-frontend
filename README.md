# Project Name

A brief description of your project and what it does.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js (v22 or above)
- pnpm (Node package manager)
- Git (if cloning from a repository)

You can install pnpm globally by running:

```bash
npm install -g pnpm
```

You can check your Node.js version by running:

```bash
node -v
```

If you need to upgrade Node.js, visit https://nodejs.org/ for installation instructions.

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

If you haven't already, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
cd your-repository
```

### 2. Install dependencies

To install the project dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pnpm install
```

This will install all the required packages listed in `package.json`.

### 3. Run the development server

After installing the dependencies and setting up environment variables, you can start the vite development server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will start the application locally at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
